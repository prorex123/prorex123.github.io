<h2>Mad T-Shirt</h2>
<i>What is it?</i>
<br>MAD T-SHIRT is a tip for remembering musical features by going through 9 key parts of any musical piece.<p>They are:<p>Melody,<br>Articulation,<br>Dynamics,<br>Texture,<br>Structure,<br>Harmony (tonality),<br>Instrumentation,<br>Rhythm,<br>Tempo.
<h2>And the Glory of the Lord</h2>
<i>Melody</i>
<p>Melody 1: A major triad followed by an ascending scalic melody, syllabic (11)'And the Glory, the glory of the lord'.<br>
  Melody 2: Scalic, descending sequence, using Melismas (17) 'Shall be revealed'.<br>
  Melody 3: repeated descending scale (3 notes) (47) 'And all flesh shall see it together'.<br>
  Melody 4: ling monotone repeated notes (low, sustained)(51)'For the mouth of the lord hath spoken it'.
<p><i>Articulation</i>
<p>Melody 1 and 4 are Syllabic.<br>
  Melody 2 and 3 are melismatic.<br>
  Word setting is used where the words or syllables are important, and so will be stressed on the 1st beat of a bar, or on a high note.
<p><i>Dynamics</i><p>Dynamics are only cued for the Continuo basso; [p] when there is a new melodic line being introduced or when the texture is thin, [f] when there is a homophonic or polyphonic texture being explored in the lyrics or against the accompaniment.<p><i>Texture</i><p>Homophony, polyphony and monophony are all used to create a richer texture, each new melody begins with just a single mono- homophonic line, then is interweaved with polyphony and homophony around the accompaniment.<br>Contrapuntal melodic lines.<p><i>Structure</i><p>4 main musical ideas (Melody 1-4).<br>Intro, melody 1, melody 2 (interweaved with melody 1), melody 3 and melody 4 (interweaved), then all parts interweaved polyphonically towards the ending of a dramatic pause, then Plagal cadence to finish.<p><i>Harmony (tonality)</i><p>Starts of in A Major, then modulates to E Major (bar 24), the Plagal cadence at the end of the first section (bar 38) establishes the key of E Major when the sops. Slide from E to D#. Bar 42 shows the last D# before bar 47 where the D is natural .<br>A Major. It then modulates back to the dominant E Major (bar 65) and then goes to its dominant, B Major (bar 67). It then resolves back to E Major (bar 89) before finalising back to the home key in bar 106 with a D(natural).<p><i>Instrumentation</i><p>Violin,<br>Viola,<br>SATB Choir,<br>Continuo bass (cello).<p><i>Rhythm</i><p>The piece is in Â¾.<br>Dotted rhythms in the first 2 melodies give a syncopated feel to the piece.<p><i>Tempo</i><p>The beginning is Allegro (fast moving), but changes to Adagio (slow) at the end, for the final cadence.
