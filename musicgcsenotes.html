<h2>Mad T-Shirt</h2>
<i>What is it?</i>
<br>MAD T-SHIRT is a tip for remembering musical features by going through 9 key parts of any musical piece.<p>They are:<p>Melody,<br>Articulation,<br>Dynamics,<br>Texture,<br>Structure,<br>Harmony (tonality),<br>
Instrumentation,<br>Rhythm,<br>Tempo.
<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/LUi0c-wsITg" target="new">And the Glory of the Lord</a></h2>
<i>Melody</i>
<p>Melody 1: A major triad followed by an ascending scalic melody, syllabic (11)'And the Glory, the glory of the lord'.<br>
  Melody 2: Scalic, descending sequence, using Melismas (17) 'Shall be revealed'.<br>
  Melody 3: repeated descending scale (3 notes) (47) 'And all flesh shall see it together'.<br>
  Melody 4: ling monotone repeated notes (low, sustained)(51)'For the mouth of the lord hath spoken it'.
<p><i>Articulation</i>
<p>Melody 1 and 4 are Syllabic.<br>
  Melody 2 and 3 are melismatic.<br>
  Word setting is used where the words or syllables are important, and so will be stressed on the 1st beat of a bar, or on a high note.
<p><i>Dynamics</i><p>Dynamics are only cued for the Continuo basso; [p] when there is a new melodic line being introduced or when the texture is thin, [f] when there is a homophonic or polyphonic texture being explored in the lyrics or against the accompaniment.<p><i>Texture</i><p>Homophony, polyphony and monophony are all used to create a richer texture, each new melody begins with just a single mono- homophonic line, then is interweaved with polyphony and homophony around the accompaniment.<br>Contrapuntal melodic lines.<p><i>Structure</i><p>4 main musical ideas (Melody 1-4).<br>Intro, melody 1, melody 2 (interweaved with melody 1), melody 3 and melody 4 (interweaved), then all parts interweaved polyphonically towards the ending of a dramatic pause, then Plagal cadence to finish.<p><i>Harmony (tonality)</i><p>Starts of in A Major, then modulates to E Major (bar 24), the Plagal cadence at the end of the first section (bar 38) establishes the key of E Major when the sops. Slide from E to D#. Bar 42 shows the last D# before bar 47 where the D is natural .<br>A Major. It then modulates back to the dominant E Major (bar 65) and then goes to its dominant, B Major (bar 67). It then resolves back to E Major (bar 89) before finalising back to the home key in bar 106 with a D(natural).<p><i>Instrumentation</i><p>Violin,<br>Viola,<br>SATB Choir,<br>Continuo bass (cello).<p><i>Rhythm</i><p>The piece is in Â¾.<br>Dotted rhythms in the first 2 melodies give a syncopated feel to the piece.<p><i>Tempo</i>
<p>The beginning is Allegro (fast moving), but changes to Adagio (slow) at the end, for the final cadence.
<p><h2><a href="https://youtu.be/mr9cT2Jlct8" target="new">40th Symphony in G minor</a></h2>
<i>Melody</i>
<p>Subject 1: a repeating 3 note (quaver quaver crotchet) pattern that is then answered by a descending G minor (quaver quaver crotchet rhythm) scale, bridged by ascending interval of a 6th.<br>
Subject 2: descending chromatic scale played in a call and response style, where the strings play first, then woodwind, then strings, then they switch the calling and answering. The melody seems slower due to the [p] dynamics and augmented notes.
<p><i>Articulation</i>
<p>Subject 2 uses more legato notes to help create the relaxed feel to contrast the less legato and more staccato sounding notes of the first subject.<br>
Staccato triads in the bridge passage help emphasise the key (Bb) and help keep the beat, as they are all on beat.
<p><i>Dynamics</i>
<p>Dynamics are used to emphasise a section or part within a thick texture. [p] is normally used in thin textures or to bring in a new subject.
<p><i>Texture</i>
<p>The horns create a very thick texture and helps in most places with harmonising or playing chords.
<p><i>Structure</i>
<p>First subject<br>
Bridge passage<br>
Second subject<br>
Codetta<br>
Development<br>
Recapitulation<br>
Coda
<p><i>Harmony (tonality)</i>
<p>Starts in the key of G minor - sad atmosphere, but combined with the high pitches of the first subject, it seems joyful.<br>
Switches to Bb major in second part of exposition for subject 2.<br>
Development explores a range of new keys: Em, Am, Dm, Gm, C, F, Bb.<br>
Recapitulation starts off in Gm, briefly going to Fm and Em before going back to Gm for subject 2 (which is in Gm for the recapitulation).
<p><i>Instrumentation</i>
<p>1 Flute, 2 Oboes, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns (one Bb one G) Violins, Violas, Double Bass/Cello.
<p>Subject 1 - Strings.<br>
Subject 2 - Strings and Woodwind first, then switch.
<p><i>Rhythm</i>
<p>Whole piece is in 4/4.<br>
  Counter melodies are used during the bridge passages to create a anticipating and excited feel.<p><i>Tempo</i>
<p>The piece is the 1st movement, so is alway Molto Allegro.
<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/y1_9vEnARNg" target="new">Raindrop Prelude</a></h2>
<p><i>Melody</i></p>
<p>Lots of ornamentation in the first melodies and in section A: acciaccaturas and appoggiaturas.<br>
Melody starts in right hand in section A, moves to right in section B, back again in A1.<br>
Dominant Pedal note of Ab repeated to simulate raindrop pattering.<br>
Falling motif of 'F Db Ab' to simulate rain drop.</p>
<p><i>Articulation</i></p>
<p>Pedal used to help the piece flow.<br>
No use of staccato notes, only legato, and accented notes (always on beats 1 and 3 to help with the rhythm).</p>
<p><i>Dynamics</i></p>
<p>Changes from [p] to [f] very quickly, in some places in 2 bars, in B section, the piece changes dynamics gradually, creating the sense of the storm getting heavier and softer.</p>
<p><i> Texture</i></p>
<p>Melody and accompaniment.</p>
<p><i>Structure</i></p>
<p>Ternary form. (A, B, A1)<br>
A: storm starting.<br>
B: storm in full force.<br>
A1: storm ending.</p>
<p><i>Harmony (tonality)</i></p>
<p>A: Db Major, then Ab Minor, Bb minor, then back to Db major.<br>
B: C# Minor (tonic minor of Db Major), then to E major, and back to C#.<br>
A1: Back to home key (Db Major).<br>
Chords help support the B section, and chordal sections are used in the later part of A, and the final 6 bars of A1</p>
<p><i>Instrumentation</i></p>
<p>Piano soloist</p>
<p><i>Rhythm</i></p>
<p>The whole piece is in 4/4.<br>
Dotted rhythms add syncopation to raindrop pattern.</p>
<p><i>Tempo</i></p>
<p>Rubato at the beginning, to help the pianist express feeling in the music, then to Rit. At the end, slowing down the piece at the final perfect cadence creating the sense that the rain is stopping.<br>
Demisemiquavers makes the piece sound faster, adding to the raindrop effect.</p>
